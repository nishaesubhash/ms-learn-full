summary: |-
  This one-day instructor-led course is intended for Microsoft Project users that need to manage a schedule but will NOT be managing cost within Project. By focusing only on the SCHEDULING capabilities of Project, this course dramatically simplifies this powerful application, thus the name&#58; Tame Microsoft Project! In addition to the student manual, this course uses a Project Template (.mpp) and additional tabs to the Ribbon, both of which simplify the interface for the user.

  #### Audience profile
  This course is intended for Project users who need to use Microsoft Project to create schedules with clear task responsibility and to regularly update those plans with schedule progress information, but who DO NOT use the cost management or resource allocation views of Microsoft Project. The audience for this course could be people managing large or small projects, part-time teams or dedicated teams, and people who are new to Project.
