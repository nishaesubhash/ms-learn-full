summary: |-
  The course starts with an overview of the product, giving insight into potential uses, followed by an installation module to familiarize you with how the product works behind the scenes. The rest of the course is dedicated to learning how to build and manage workflows, starting small with simple approval workflows but soon growing in sophistication as the workflows grow and you learn how to work with a variety of techniques including serial approval, loops, variables, database connections, error handling and state machines.

  #### Audience profile
  This course will suit a varied audience from developers to sales people.
prerequisitesSection: |-
  This course is a demanding three days aimed at delegates that are already experienced users of SharePoint. No prior knowledge of Nintex Workflow is needed but some previous experience of Nintex Workflow would be an advantage.
