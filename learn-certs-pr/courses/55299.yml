  ### Module 2&#58; Page Content
  SharePoint offers a couple of ways to add content to the pages in a site. The latest technique and the one implemented by the Team Site template is through site style pages. Another method that has been part of SharePoint in past is the use of Wiki and Web Part pages. The Wiki and Web Part techniques are similar in the output that can be created, and both share the ability to add Web Parts (an instance of an app with a view) to them.

  ### Module 3&#58; Site Columns and Content Types
  One method of customizing SharePoint, in a way that can be reused throughout the site or site collection or even the whole farm, is to create Site Columns and Content Types. Site columns are the simplest element; they are essentially the same as list and library columns except that you create them at the site level and then they can be used throughout that site and any child site. Content Types are a combination of Site Columns as well as additional settings and information such as document templates and workflows. Content Types, once created, can then be linked to lists and libraries.

  ### Module 4&#58; Managing SharePoint Site Permissions
  Permissions on a SharePoint site are assigned when a site is created. The default is that permissions assigned to the root of a site collection are inherited by child sites. At any time, permissions inheritance can be turned off at a site, list, library, or even at the item level in a list or library. The permissions themselves can be assigned to either SharePoint groups, individual users, or groups created outside of SharePoint such as Windows groups.

The main difference being that it is controlled by the SharePoint Farm and exposure is typically limited to internal networks.
