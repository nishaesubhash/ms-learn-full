summary: |-
  What do we mean by no code? It is a matter of perspective. In today’s world the successful software vendor needs to develop software that is easily customizable by casual users. In the realm of business intelligence that means offering a variety of tools to different types of users that, depending on their experience, they can utilize to rapidly create the visualization of data that suits their needs. Microsoft has produced a great array of such tools that target different users. These tools are various Wizards, Dialog Boxes, Forms, Web Pages Designers and so forth. In this course we utilize the built in tools and do not write a single line of code! 

  No Code visualization means using the data structures that exist already to get the job done. You don’t have the time or maybe the inclination to learn how to code but you need answers. I.T., if you haven’t already noticed, is always working through a backlog but your business situation is dynamic and rapidly changing and will not wait for any backlog. In this course you will learn how to get those answers without submitting a request and waiting.

  #### Audience profile
  The target audience of this course is for Business Analysts, Report Designers, Team Leads, SharePoint Administrators, Business Intelligence Developers and Project Managers that will be tasked with the implementation, support, management or training needed to rapidly empower the users to take advantage of the exploding world of Data V.
