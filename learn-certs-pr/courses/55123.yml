  ### Module 1&#58; Exploring the Report Builder Environment
  This module introduces the Report Builder application and its features. You will explore the Ribbon and its Tabs, Command groups, and Commands, the available Window panes for creating and manipulating reports, and the report design surface using Design and Run modes.
  #### Lessons
  - Introducing the Report Builder Environment
  - Working with Existing Reports


  #### Lab &#58; Exploring the Report Builder Application
  - Navigating the Ribbon and Window panes
  - View Existing Reports in Design and Run modes
  - Describe and navigate the graphical elements of the Report Builder application.
  - Work with existing reports and navigate between Design and Run modes.


  ### Module 2&#58; Adding Data to Table Reports
  This module introduces how to populate a report with data and display that data in a table data region on the report. We will begin with defining the data source and continue with query building through data sets to bring data into the report. Next, we will explore the elements of the tablix data region including rows, columns, cells, handles, and field choosers, you will use in displaying your data.
  #### Lessons
  - Create Report Data Sources
  - Create Report Datasets
  - Work with the Tablix Data Region
  - Create a Table Report


  #### Lab &#58; Creating Table Reports
  - Create Queries Using the Report Builder Query Designer
  - Create Queries Using the Report Builder Query Designer
  - Create Table Relationships Using Query Designer
  - Create a Table Report Using Multiple Tables
  - Create report data sources.
  - Create report datasets.
  - Work with the tablix data region.
  - Create a table report


  ### Module 3&#58; Formatting Data and Creating Expressions in Reports
  This module introduces report formatting techniques which allow a report writer to control how and where data displays in the report. Additional data may also be required and this can be accomplished by adding data from a source or adding a calculated field to the dataset. Simple and complex expressions will also be introduced in this topic.
  #### Lessons
  - Formatting Reports
  - Sorting and Filtering Report Data
  - Adding Data to a Dataset
  - Creating Simple Expressions
  - Creating Complex Expressions


  #### Lab &#58; Formatting Reports
  - Format Tablix Columns
  - Format Data in a Tablix Cell Using Properties
  - Format Data in a Tablix Cell Using Simple and Complex Expressions
  - Sort Data Using Expressions
  - Use Simple and Complex Expressions to Display Data in a Tablix
  - Format data in a report using the Report Builder Properties dialog boxes.
  - Add data to a report and make changes to column names in the dataset query.
  - Format data in a report using simple and complex expressions.
  - Display data in a report using simple and complex expressions.


  ### Module 4&#58; Grouping Report Data
  This module introduces data groupings in reports using dataset fields and using expressions. This module also discusses group hierarchies and adding aggregates to summarize grouped data.
  #### Lessons
  - Group Data in Reports
  - Group Data Using an Expression
  - Creating Subgroups and Group Aggregates


  #### Lab &#58; Creating Reports with Groups and Aggregates
  - Display Grouped Data in a Report
  - Create a Group Hierarchy in a Report
  - Group Data Using a Complex Expression
  - Add Aggregates to Tablix Rows
  - Configuring a Reference Image
  - Group data in reports using fields
  - Group data in reports using expressions.
  - Create group hierarchies.
  - Aggregate grouped data in a report.


  ### Module 5&#58; Matrix Reports
  This module introduces matrix data regions which are used in reports to control how crosstabular data can be used. While table reports rely on rows and columns, matrix reports rely on row groupings, column groupings, and aggregated values.
  #### Lessons
  - Creating and Modifying Matrix Data Regions
  - Creating and Modifying Column Groups


  #### Lab &#58; Creating Matrix Reports
  - Create Matrix Reports
  - Create Column Groups
  - Use Expressions to Sort Group Data

  - Describe the key features of using a matrix in a report.
  - Create and modify matrix reports.
  - Define column group hierarchies.
  - Use expressions to define matrix headings and sort orders.


  ### Module 6&#58; Charts
  This module introduces the ability to create and add charts to reports. Whether through wizard or individual effort, chart reports or charts as report components allow us to visualize data with or without the details.
  #### Lessons
  - Create and Modify Chart Wizard Reports
  - Add Charts to Existing Reports
  - Modify Charts in Reports


  #### Lab &#58; Creating Charts and Chart Reports
  - Create a Chart Wizard Report
  - Add a Chart to an Existing Report
