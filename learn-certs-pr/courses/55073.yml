summary: |-
  Studies show that data decays at about 2% a month all organizations need to work from reliable information while ensuring that the integrity of information and consistency of data is constant across different applications. Microsoft SQL Server 2012-2014 Master Data Services is a powerful feature designed to help an organization create a structure and hierarchy for data, so that data collected and used across multiple departments, silos and databases is standardized and aligned. This ensures that different databases are interoperable. When combined with Data Quality Services and Excel a complete end to end system is available.

  #### Audience profile
  This course is intended for SQL Professionals, Business Intelligence Developers, Data Analysts and Data Stewards and Project Managers that need to learn how to utilize Master Data Services.

  - Configure Master Data Services.


  ### Module 4&#58; UNDERSTANDING DATA MODELS
  We touched on the basics of the MDS object model already and covered core concepts such as entities, attributes, members and hierarchies. In this module we will expand on that and take an in-depth look at all the objects in the MDS model. In addition we will examine modeling concepts and deployment.
  #### Lessons
  - Modeling Process
  - MDS Object - Model
  - The Model Object


  #### Lab &#58; UNDERSTANDING DATA MODELS

  - Create a leaf member with T-SQL.
  - Delete a member with the web interface and examine results in SSMS.
  - View errors in batch files.
  - Load leaf members with SQL Server Integration Services and flat files.


  ### Module 6&#58; VERSION MANAGEMENT

  ### Module 8&#58; MDS SECURITY
  The goal this module is to gain an understanding of the security in MDS. The security in some ways follows other security paradigms that you may be used to. Such as the concept of read, write, and deny permissions. However, the concepts such as granting permission to the model object for all groups of users so they can view the model may be foreign to you. Also make sure that you understand that MDS does not control security; that it is controlled by active directory. It is within active directory that the passwords and usernames are stored along with the user groups.
