summary: |-
  This fast-paced course makes these assumptions&#58;
  - You already have SharePoint 2013 deployed as this is not a planning or installation course.
  - The student will or may be called on to perform administration or maintenance of SharePoint and the frequency of these calls may vary meaning you may have forgotten how to perform a procedure.
  - The student is not a SharePoint IT professional, and this course is not intended to make you one. There are other, much longer, and more detailed courses that set you on that path.
  - The student wants clear explanations with as little jargon as possible.
  - The student needs take-always they can rapidly go back to quickly if called on to perform administration.
  
  Everything in this course, and indeed almost every course you ever take on Microsoft technology can also be located in MSDN, or TechNet, or a Microsoft blog. So then why take this course? You will get there faster, you will understand want you need to, and you will have a video toolkit to remind you how to perform procedures.  
  In this course&#58;
  - You will go through an explanation of each procedure.   
  - The procedure will be explained and you will practice both manually, and with PowerShell, so you can choose which to use. 
  - If PowerShell is used, you will have clearly shown, in color on a PowerPoint where you may need to insert your custom parameters.
  - You will practice every procedure with an instructor available to answer any questions.
  
   You will receive videos of every procedure showing step-by-step how to perform the procedure. By taking the course the author grants you the permission to upload the videos to a library in SharePoint at your organization.

  #### Audience profile
  This course is intended for IT Pros, Developers, and Power Users.
