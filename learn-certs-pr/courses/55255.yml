  ### Module 2&#58; SharePoint 365 Introduction
  SharePoint 365 is a collaboration tool at its heart. Its primary goal is to make it easy for users to find and share information, and there are many features built into SharePoint to facilitate this. SharePoint's library system feature can provide a superior alternative to the traditional file server. SharePoint lists can be an easy-to-design and easy-to-use alternative to sharing spreadsheet files or more formal database tables. Both lists and libraries can be customized and extended to provide enhanced appearances and functionality. All of this collaboration can be done through a browser interface.

  ### Module 3&#58; SharePoint List Basics
  Lists are a fundamental building block in SharePoint that provides a way for users to store and view data. SharePoint comes "out of the box" with many predefined list templates that are easy to use. Lists can be further customized by adding columns to store just about any type of information. Additionally, list columns can be validated as well as linked between other lists. Lists are a very flexible and powerful tool in SharePoint.

  ### Module 4&#58; Library Basics
  SharePoint Libraries share the same characteristics as SharePoint lists such as columns, views, and validation to name a few. What distinguishes SharePoint libraries is that each item in a library has an underlying document. So in addition to the data stored in library columns, the document stores its own data based on the type of document. Because of the extra data that can be stored in columns that can be used to filter and search by and features such as versioning, libraries are considered a great replacement for the more traditional file server system. Libraries are, like lists, a fundamental building block in a SharePoint site.

  #### Lessons
  - Library Templates
  - Creating Libraries
  - Creating a Document Library and Adding Columns
  - Managing Documents and Versioning

  ### Module 5&#58; Working with Lists and Library Views
  Views provide a flexible system to display SharePoint list and library data in an easy-to-read and easy-to-use manner. Every SharePoint list and library can have multiple views created and configured, and some list and library templates come with special views preconfigured. Views can be defined for personal use or shared use.

  ### Module 6&#58; Working with Sites
  All SharePoint content is accessed through a site. A SharePoint site is the container for lists and libraries and provides a starting point for basic administration. The content, lists, libraries, and basic look and feel of a site is initially determined by the Site Template used to create the site.

  #### Lessons

  ### Module 7&#58; Page Content
  SharePoint offers a couple of ways to add content to the pages in a site. The latest technique and the one implemented by the Team Site template is through wiki style pages. Another method that has been part of SharePoint since the beginning is the use of Web Parts and Web Part pages. Both techniques are similar in the output that can be created, and both Web Part pages and wiki pages share the ability to add Web Parts to them.
  #### Lessons

  ### Module 8&#58; Site Columns and Content Types
  One method of customizing SharePoint, in a way that can be reused throughout the site or site collection or even the whole farm, is to create Site Columns and Content Types. Site columns are the simplest element; they are essentially the same as list and library columns except that you create them at the site level and then they can be used throughout that site and any child site. Content Types are a combination of Site Columns as well as additional settings and information such as document templates and workflows. Content Types, once created, can then be linked to lists and libraries.
  #### Lessons

  ### Module 9&#58; Office Integration
  One of the nice features of SharePoint is its ability to integrate with Microsoft Office applications. Note that this chapter explores integration with Office Online products, a browser-based version of Office that allows you to create and modify office documents. There are limits and they do not perform exactly as their locally installed counterparts.
  #### Lessons
  - Outlook Integration


  #### Lab &#58; Outlook Integration
  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;
  - Create an alert.


  ### Module 10&#58; Managing SharePoint Site Permissions
  Permissions on a SharePoint site are assigned when a site is created. The default is that permissions assigned to the root of a site collection are inherited by child sites. At any time, permissions inheritance can be turned off at a site, list, library, or even at the item level in a list or library. The permissions themselves can be assigned to either SharePoint groups, individual users, or groups created outside of SharePoint such as Windows groups.

  #### Lessons
