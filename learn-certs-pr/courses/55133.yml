summary: |-
  This three-day instructor-led course provides students with the knowledge and skills needed to use PowerShell for System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) administration. In this course, students learn how to access the PowerShell cmdlets included with SCCM 1802 and use them to perform configuration tasks for a primary site. Individual cmdlets will be used in working with objects such as Boundaries, Boundary Groups, Collections, Software Deployment, Patching, Compliance Settings, OSD Task Sequences, and many others. Basic scripting will also be covered so that students can learn how to put PowerShell to use when working with large sets of objects.

  #### Audience profile
  This course is intended for IT professionals who need to manage the day-to-day environment of an SCCM 1802 or newer environment. Knowledge of the workings of a standalone primary SCCM site and basic
