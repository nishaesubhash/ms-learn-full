  - Multi-Site Clustering
  - Flexible Failover Policy


  #### Lab &#58; AlwaysOn
  - None
  - Understand SQL failover cluster implementation.
  - Understand multi-site clustering.
  - Understand flexible failover policy.
  - Understand and utilize AlwaysOn.


  ### Module 4&#58; Understanding Quorums
  Quorums determine the number of failures that a cluster can sustain, and if additional failures occur, the cluster will stop running. In this module, we discuss how to configure the quorum, and explain the options available.

  - Understand node and file share majority.
  - Understand no majority.
  - Understand configuration options.
  - Understand and utilize quorums.


  ### Module 5&#58; AlwaysOn Availability Groups
  SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups provide us the capability to group two or more databases and perform a failover of both as a logical unit. In this module, we will explore how to configure and utilize Availability Groups.
  #### Lessons
  - Application Failover
  - Availability Group (AG)
  - Availability Replica


  #### Lab &#58; AlwaysOn Availability Groups
  - Enable AlwaysOn in SQL Server
  - Testing Failover Cluster and Adding Sample Databases
  - Create the High Availability Group
  - Add Replica and Listener
  - Understand application failover.
  - Understand availability groups.
  - Understand availability replicas.
  - Understand and utilize AlwaysOn availability groups.


  ### Module 6&#58; Secondary Availability Group Actions
  In AlwaysOn Availability Groups, an active secondary can be used for things like redirecting the read-only workload, off-loading the backup load, and other tasks. In this module, we discuss how an active secondary replica operates, and explore a few tasks that can be tackled using a secondary.
  #### Lessons
  - Active Secondary Replicas
  - Readable Secondary Replicas
  - Backups on Secondary Replicas


  #### Lab &#58; Secondary Availability Group Actions
  - None
  - Understand active secondary replicas.
