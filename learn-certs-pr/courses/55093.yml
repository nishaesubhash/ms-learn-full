summary: |-
  This three day course introduces into Windows Azure Storage consisting of features like tables, blobs, queues and drives and how these features can be used in combination between IaaS and PaaS as well as on-premise components and how Azure Storage can be combined with classic SQL concepts. New no-sql storage mechanisms substitute relational database engines, ‘old’ terms like database and foreign keys are substituted with new paradigm changing concepts like collections of entities, primary keys providing data flow controls through datacenter, key/value pair constructs for metadata based mass structured data access, and binary data stores via Blob services. High performance, secure and reliable message handling for string, xml or binary content via Azure and Windows Azure Drives that allow you to read and write data to blob storage using standard file system functions will be explored from a developer, ITPro and end-user perspective.

  #### Audience profile
  This course is intended for IT Professional (IT Pros), Developers and Architects.  
  
  IT Professional (IT Pros) who also create software applications, build or write computer code or develop Web sites or complex macros as a secondary responsibility and Developers who create software applications, develop web sites, create complex macros. Both should have a minimum of three months programming experience in C# and have basic Visual Studio 2010 or Visual Studio 2012 or Visual Studio 2013 navigation skills and Architects tasked with transitioning of on-Premise Data to Microsoft Azure Cloud or tasked to build Hybrid solution defined as continuous data pipe between on-premise and Cloud.
