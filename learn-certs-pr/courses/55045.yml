summary: |-
  This seven-day instructor-led course is a complete high-level tour of the Microsoft Business Intelligence stack. It introduces students to the SQL 2012 Business Intelligence and SharePoint 2013 Business Intelligence services including PerformancePoint Service, Excel Services, Business Connectivity Services, Visio Services and the Business Intelligence Center focusing on their interdependency.  
  Each of the modules is stand-alone allowing for customization of the course for those audiences that may not have an interest in a certain service.  
  Each concept is demonstrated with a video before the exercise on that concept, so first you will have the short lecture then see the concept demonstrated then do it yourself. Remember if you can’t do it you didn’t learn it. Each of the videos, and there are approximately 13 hours of them, is intended as a take-away from the class for each student.

  #### Audience profile
  This course is intended for Project Managers, Business Intelligence Developers, SQL Server Developers and IT Professionals that will be involved with the design, development and maintenance of SharePoint 2013 Business Intelligence solutions. The course introduces each of the services and minimizes or eliminates any coding.
prerequisitesSection: |-
  Before attending this course, students must have&#58;
  - An understanding of the benefits of business intelligence.

  ### Module 5&#58; Microsoft Multidimensional Expressions
  There are some striking differences between SQL and MDX, and you should be aware of these differences at a conceptual level. The principal difference between SQL and MDX is the ability of MDX to reference multiple dimensions. Although it is possible to use SQL exclusively to query cubes, Analysis Services MDX provides commands that are designed specifically to retrieve data as multidimensional data structures with almost any number of dimensions. We will go over key concepts in multidimensional space and browse some basic MDX statements with specific coverage on navigating hierarchies and working with time.
  #### Lessons
  - Concepts in Multidimensional Space
  - Basic MDX Statements

  ### Module 6&#58; SQL 2012 Business Intelligence Semantic Model (Tabular Mode)
  If you are starting an Analysis Services 2012 project with no previous Multidimensional or OLAP experience, it is very likely that you will find tabular much easier to learn than multidimensional. Not only are the concepts much easier to understand, especially if you are used to working with relational databases, but the development process is also much more straightforward and there are far fewer features to learn. Building your first tabular model is much quicker and easier than building your first multidimensional model. It can also be argued that DAX is easier to learn than MDX, at least when it comes to writing basic calculations, but the truth is that both MDX and DAX can be equally confusing for anyone used to SQL. In this module we cover the basics of using tabular mode and the tools available.
