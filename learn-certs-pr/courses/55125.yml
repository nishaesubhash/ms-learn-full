  - Understand version changes of SSAS from 2008-2014.
  - Understand Analysis Services installation and architecture.
  - Understand how to choose the right model.
  - Understand the Analysis Services tools available.


  ### Module 3&#58; The Multidimensional Solution
  In the multidimensional model, data is modeled as a series of cubes and dimensions. In this module we will explore how to create and configure a cube. Dimensions will be discussed in a later module.
  #### Lessons
  - Understanding the Multidimensional Model
  - Utilizing Data Sources and Data Source Views
  - Creating a Cube


  #### Lab &#58; The Multidimensional Solution

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;

  - Understand the multidimensional model.
  - Utilize data sources and data source views.
  - Create a cube.


  ### Module 4&#58; Dissecting with Dimensions
  Dimensions are the categories by which you slice your data to view specific quantities of interest. In this module we will explore dimensions and how they are used in conjunction with attributes, relationships, and hierarchies.
  #### Lessons
  - Developing Dimensions
  - Utilizing Attributes
  - Relating with Relationships
  - Handling Hierarchies


  #### Lab &#58; Dissecting with Dimensions

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;

  - Understand and utilize dimensions.
  - Understand and utilize attributes.
  - Understand and utilize relationships.
  - Understand and utilize hierarchies.


  ### Module 5&#58; Managing Measures
  Each cube is made up of one or more measure groups, and each measure group in a cube contains one or more measures. In this module we will explore all there is to know about measures and measure groups, and weâ€™ll also cover calculated members.
  #### Lessons
  - Measures and Measure Groups
  - Calculated Members


  #### Lab &#58; Managing Measures

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;

  - Understand and utilize measures and measure groups.
  - Understand and utilize calculated members.


  ### Module 6&#58; Configuring Cube Options
  Perspectives have the ability to hide certain parts of a complex model, which can help usability, and security roles can be used to deny access to specific rows of data from tables to specific users. Translations allow the metadata of a multidimensional model to appear in different languages for users with different locales on their desktops. In this module we will cover both configurations and the options available.
  #### Lessons
  - Understanding Perspectives
  - Utilizing Translations
  - Browsing Perspectives and Translations


  #### Lab &#58; Configuring Cube Options

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;
  - Understand and utilize perspectives.
  - Understand and utilize translations.
  - Browse perspectives and translations.


  ### Module 7&#58; Deploying
  Deploying an Analysis Services project creates the defined objects in an instance of Analysis Services. In this module we will explore deployment options, processing strategies, and security.
  #### Lessons
  - Examining Deployment Options
  - Processing Strategies
  - Exploring Security


  #### Lab &#58; Deploying

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;

  - Understand and utilize deployment options.
  - Understand and utilize processing strategies.
  - Understand and utilize security.
  - Deploy a multidimensional model.


  ### Module 8&#58; The Tabular Solution
  Tabular models are in-memory databases in Analysis Services. In this module we will explore the tabular model, create a tabular project, deploy and query the solution using Data Analytic Expressions (DAX).
  #### Lessons
  - Understanding the Tabular Model
  - Creating a Tabular Project
  - Deploying
  - Browsing the Model
