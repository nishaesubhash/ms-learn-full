  ### Module 1&#58; Working with Sites
  All SharePoint content is accessed through a site. A SharePoint site is the container for lists and libraries and provides a starting point for basic administration. The content, lists, libraries, and basic look and feel of a site is initially determined by the Site Template used to create the site.

  #### Lessons

  ### Module 2&#58; Page Content
  SharePoint offers a couple of ways to add content to the pages in a site. The latest technique and the one implemented by the Team Site template is through wiki style pages. Another method that has been part of SharePoint since the beginning is the use of Web Parts and Web Part pages. Both techniques are similar in the output that can be created, and both Web Part pages and wiki pages share the ability to add Web Parts to them.

  ### Module 3&#58; Site Columns and Content Types
  One method of customizing SharePoint, in a way that can be reused throughout the site or site collection or even the whole farm, is to create Site Columns and Content Types. Site columns are the simplest element; they are essentially the same as list and library columns except that you create them at the site level and then they can be used throughout that site and any child site. Content Types are a combination of Site Columns as well as additional settings and information such as document templates and workflows. Content Types, once created, can then be linked to lists and libraries.

  ### Module 4&#58; Office Integration
  One of the nice features of SharePoint is its ability to integrate with Microsoft Office applications. Note that this chapter explores integration with Office Online products, a browser-based version of Office that allows you to create and modify office documents. There are limits and they do not perform exactly as their locally installed counterparts.

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;

  ### Module 5&#58; Managing SharePoint Site Permissions
  Permissions on a SharePoint site are assigned when a site is created. The default is that permissions assigned to the root of a site collection are inherited by child sites. At any time, permissions inheritance can be turned off at a site, list, library, or even at the item level in a list or library. The permissions themselves can be assigned to either SharePoint groups, individual users, or groups created outside of SharePoint such as Windows groups.
  #### Lessons
