  ### Module 3&#58; Library Basics
  SharePoint Libraries share the same characteristics as SharePoint lists such as columns, views, and validation to name a few. What distinguishes SharePoint libraries is that each item in a library has a underlying document. So in addition to the data stored in library columns, the document stores its own data based on the type of document. Because of the extra data that can be stored in columns that can be used to filter and search by and features such as versioning, libraries are considered a great replacement for the more traditional file server system. Libraries are, like lists, a fundamental building block in a SharePoint site.

  ### Module 4&#58; Working with Lists and Library Views
  Views provide a flexible system to display SharePoint list and library data in an easy-to-read and easy-to-use manner. Every SharePoint list and library can have multiple views created and configured, and some list and library templates come with special views preconfigured. Views can be defined for personal use or shared use.
  #### Lessons

  ### Module 5&#58; Working with Sites
  All SharePoint content is accessed through a site. A SharePoint site is the container for lists and libraries and provides a starting point for basic administration. The content, lists, libraries, and basic look and feel of a site is initially determined by the Site Template used to create the site.
  #### Lessons
  - Site Templates
  - Creating Sites
  - Site Navigation


  #### Lab &#58; Working with Sites

  ### Module 6&#58; Page Content
  SharePoint offers a couple of ways to add content to the pages in a site. The latest technique and the one implemented by the Team Site template is through wiki style pages. Another method that has been part of SharePoint since the beginning is the use of Web Parts and Web Part pages. Both techniques are similar in the output that can be created, and both Web Part pages and wiki pages share the ability to add Web Parts to them. Web Part pages still have one advantage in that you can connect Web Parts so information can pass between them; that option is not available on a wiki page.
  #### Lessons
  - Wiki Library Pages
  - Web Part Pages
  - Working with Web Parts

  ### Module 7&#58; Forms Library
  SharePoint Forms library is a special library designed to store Microsoft InfoPath form documents. Microsoft InfoPath comes with a designer tool for graphically creating forms with a wide assortment of fields and controls. The InfoPath Designer can then be used to publish the forms you design to SharePoint rendering them as Web page templates for Forms libraries.
  #### Lessons
  - Creating a Forms Library
  - Creating InfoPath Forms
  - Publishing InfoPath Forms to SharePoint


  #### Lab &#58; Forms Library

  - Designate form template files as library columns.
  - Create instances of documents in a Form Library.


  ### Module 8&#58; Site Columns and Content Types
  One method of customizing SharePoint, in a way that can be reused throughout the site or site collection or even the whole farm, is to create Site Columns and Content Types. Site columns are the simplest element; they are essentially the same as list and library columns except that you create them at the site level and then they can be used throughout that site and any child site. Content Types are a combination of Site Columns as well as additional settings and information such as document templates and workflows. Content Types, once created, can then be linked to lists and libraries.
  #### Lessons
  - Site Column Gallery
  - Creating Site Columns
  - Site Content Type Gallery

  ### Module 9&#58; Office Integration
  One of the nice features of SharePoint is its ability to integrate with Microsoft Office applications. Just about every Office application offers some level of integration with SharePoint whether it be simple, such as using an Excel spreadsheet to create a new list, or more full featured, such as Outlook integration. Some integration features enhance what is available online through a browser while others allow access to SharePoint content offline such as a mobile computer environment. This lesson will use a series of walk-throughs and exercises to show how each Office application can integrate with SharePoint.
  #### Lessons
  - Excel Integration
  - Outlook Integration
  - Access Integration

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;
  - Create a list from an Excel spreadsheet.

  - Make a copy of a library in Outlook.
  - Use the Datasheet view.
  - Open and edit a list in Access.


  ### Module 10&#58; Managing SharePoint Site Permissions
  Permissions on a SharePoint site are assigned when a site is created. The default is that permissions assigned to the root of a site collection are inherited by child sites. At any time, permissions inheritance can be turned off at a site, list, library, or even at the item level in a list or library. The permissions themselves can be assigned to either SharePoint groups, individual users or groups created outside of SharePoint such as Windows groups.

  ### Module 11&#58; Participating in User Communities
  SharePoint offers users a place for social collaboration in the form of personal sites. The experience and functionality is very similar to popular social media sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn. The main difference being that it is controlled by the SharePoint Farm and exposure is typically limited to internal networks.
