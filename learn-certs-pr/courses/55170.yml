summary: |-
  In this 2-day course, students will continue their learning on the foundations of report writing with Microsoft® SQL Server® Report Designer and SSRS. The focus will be on report creation by connecting to a database and manipulating the data for presentation including&#58; creating parameter reports, creating list reports, adding complex expressions to reports, adding images and subreports to reports, adding drilldown and drillthrough functionality, and adding sparklines, data bars, and indicators to reports. Report Designer is available for all supported versions of Microsoft® SQL Server®.

  #### Audience profile
  The primary audience for this course are persons who are new to reporting with Microsoft® SQL Server® Report Designer and SSRS, persons who are transitioning from another reporting software application, and persons who are existing Report Builder and SSRS report authors.

  ### Module 1&#58; Parameter Reports
  This module introduces the use of the parameter in report writing. Parameters allow a level of self-service reporting wherein the report audience can choose the data to view (date range, department, geography, etc.).
  #### Lessons
  - Parameterized Reporting
  - Create Report Parameters
  - Modify Report Parameters
  - Provide Default Parameter Values
  - Provide Available Values for Parameters


  #### Lab &#58; Creating Parameterized Reports
  - Create Single Value Parameter Reports
  - Create Multi-Value Parameter Reports
  - Create an Available Values Parameter Report
  - Create a Parameter Report with Default Values
  - Modify Existing Parameter Reports

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;
  - Describe the key benefits and features of report parameters.
  - Create parameterized queries and parameterized reports.
  - Create parameters which accept single values, multiple values, expose or hide the parameter value, provide a list of available parameter values, and provide parameters with default values.
  - Modify existing parameters and parameter reports.


  ### Module 2&#58; List Data Regions
  This module introduces the list data region. List data regions allow report writers free-form control over their reports, whereas, table and matrix reports bind you to a table or matrix data presentation. This free-form feature affords the report writer the ability to truly customize the report.
  #### Lessons
  - Introducing the List Data Region
  - Create Reports Using List Data Regions
  - Modify Reports Which Use List Data Regions


  #### Lab &#58; Creating List Reports
  - Create a Multiple Column Report with List Data Regions
  - Create a Report with Rectangles and Nested Data
  - Create an Enhanced Report with Rectangles and List Data Regions

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;
  - Describe the benefits of list data regions and rectangles in reporting scenarios.
  - Create reports which display data in multiple columns.
  - Create reports which take advantage of nested data.
  - Create enhanced reports using list data regions and rectangles.


  ### Module 3&#58; Enhancing Reports with Complex Expressions
  This module introduces several new report formatting techniques which allow the report writer better control over the data displayed in the report.
  #### Lessons
  - Formatting Reports
  - Top N Reports
  - Running Values


  #### Lab &#58; Enhancing Reports with Complex Expressions
  - Create Conditional Formats for Data
  - Use Complex Expressions in Charts
  - Calculate Running Values in Table and Matrix Data Regions
  - Create TOP N Reports
  - Add Row Banding in Table and Matrix Reports

  After completing this module, students will be able to&#58;
  - Create conditional formats for data displayed in a report.
  - Use complex expressions in charts.
  - Calculate running values for groups and datasets.
  - Create TOP N reports for groups and datasets.
  - Use row banding in a data region


  ### Module 4&#58; Enhance Reports with Images and Subreports
  In this module, students will add images and reports (subreports) to reports, tour  and students will be introduced to SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services).
  #### Lessons
  - Add Images to Reports
  - Retrieve Images from a Database
  - Introducing SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) Report Server
  - Add Subreports to Reports


  #### Lab &#58; Working With Images and Subreports
  - Add an Image to an Existing Report
  - Display Images from a Database in a Report
  - Format HTML5 Data to Display Properly in a Report
  - Use SSRS Report Server to Facilitate Subreporting
  - Add Subreports to a Report
  - Add Parameterized Subreports to Reports
  - Describe the available options for adding images to reports.
  - Add images to reports.
  - Describe the features of SSRS Report Server
  - Add subreports and parameterized subreports to reports.


  ### Module 5&#58; Drilldown and Drillthrough Reports
  This module introduces the ToggleByItem and Action properties to incorporate drilldowns and drillthrough reporting.
