summary: |-
  This three-day instructor-led course is designed for database administrators and Windows engineers to familiarize them with the concepts in SQL AlwaysOn and High Availability. The course utilizes SQL 2016, but explains the differences from SQL 2012- SQL 2014.

  #### Audience profile
  Experienced DBAs, Windows Server pros, team leads. This is a lab intense course! 
  We designed this course based on our experience of having taught hundreds of classes to literally thousands of students. We tried very hard to make the labs, of which there are over 30, very oriented to a single concept such as Adding a Replica or Transferring Logons. We did this because it is common in technical courses to write long labs with multiple exercises which in our opinion is not effective as they turn into ?click streams?. We assume the student is new to the technology and that the instructor is knowledgeable in it.
