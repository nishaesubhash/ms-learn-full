  (ITSM) and the business value of well-designed and delivered services.

  #### Audience profile
  The target audience of the ITIL Practitioner certificate in IT Service Management is IT professionals who must demonstrate the skills to apply ITIL concepts in their organization, ensuring maximum business value by delivering fit-for-purpose and fit-for-use services.
prerequisitesSection: |-
  - ITIL Foundation is a prerequisite to take ITIL Practitioner as it supplements, rather than substitutes the Foundation qualification. To that end the ITIL Practitioner syllabus will require delegates to have passed their ITIL Foundation exam and be familiar with the principles of ITSM and the organization-wide common language of ITIL. These learnings will be put in context to answer the ‘how’ of successful improvement initiatives with ITIL Practitioner, which is the next step after Foundation, not a substitution.
