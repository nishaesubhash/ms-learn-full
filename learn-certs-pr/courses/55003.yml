summary: |-
  This four-day instructor-led course provides students with the necessary knowledge to work with all the associated SharePoint 2010 Business Intelligence services including PerformancePoint Service, Excel Services, Business Connectivity Services, Visio Services and the Business Intelligence Center.
  
  The focus of this course is on the SharePoint business intelligence platform and not on the SQL business intelligence services.The course uses SQL 2012, however, as far as possible the course design is agnostic towards the version of SQL used from SQL 2008 forward with the exception of certain features which are clearly pointed out in the courseware.
  
  Again as far as possible each of the modules are standalone allowing for customization of the course for those audiences that may not have an interest in a certain service. The course includes a complete build guide for use of the students that they may duplicate the environment in which they learned on their work computer. This would have certain hardware and software requirements which would need to be met.

  #### Audience profile
