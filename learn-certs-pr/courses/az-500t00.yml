summary: |-
  This course provides IT Security Professionals with the knowledge and skills needed to implement security controls, maintain an organizationâ€™s security posture, and identify and remediate security vulnerabilities. This course includes security for identity and access, platform protection, data and applications, and security operations.

  #### Audience profile
  This course is for Azure Security Engineers who are planning to take the associated certification exam, or who are performing security tasks in their day-to-day job. This course would also be helpful to an engineer that wants to specialize in providing security for Azure-based digital platforms and play an integral role in protecting an organization's data.
prerequisitesSection: |-  
  Successful learners will have prior knowledge and understanding of&#58;
  - Security best practices and industry security requirements such as defense in depth, least privileged access, role-based access control, multi-factor authentication, shared responsibility, and zero trust model.
  - Be familiar with security protocols such as Virtual Private Networks (VPN), Internet Security Protocol (IPSec), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), disk and data encryption methods.
  - Have some experience deploying Azure workloads. This course does not cover the basics of Azure administration, instead the course content builds on that knowledge by adding security specific information.
  - Have experience with Windows and Linux operating systems and scripting languages. Course labs may use PowerShell and the CLI.
