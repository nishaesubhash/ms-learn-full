summary: |-
  Course 55202 is designed to get you up and running with Desired State Configuration (DSC). PowerShell DSC was introduced in version 4 and has been greatly expanded and enhanced in version 5. DSC goes
  hand-in-glove with implementation of DevOps the revolutionary methodology to join the development and operations teams. Now you can “declare” your desired environment and the DSC structure will “make it so” and keep it so!

  #### Audience profile
  This is considered a skillset that all operations team need to master, and all developers should be familiar with the technology so they can develop DSC Resources to be used in deploying their software.
