# Our New Fundamentals Certification Program Launches with Microsoft Azure and Microsoft 365

Posted 29 Nov 2018 by **Liberty Munson (Microsoft)**

Microsoft is pleased to announce the first two of its new Fundamentals certification exams—Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, available December 31, 2018, and M365 Fundamentals, available December 29, 2018! These certifications form the foundation of our [role-based certification program](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/browse-new-certification.aspx) that we launched in September 2018, and are designed to validate that you have a core level of knowledge on the technologies required for a given job role.

Take [Exam AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-AZ-900.aspx) as an example. This exam is designed for candidates looking to demonstrate foundational knowledge of cloud services and how those services are implemented with Microsoft Azure. The exam is intended for those of you who don’t have a technical background but have an interest in the cloud, such as those involved in selling or purchasing cloud-based solutions and services; those you with a technical background who have a need to validate your foundational level knowledge around cloud services; and those of you who are simply interested in exploring the world of cloud-based solutions to determine if it’s the building block you need to change your career.

The AZ-900 Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam can be taken as an **optional** first step in learning about cloud services and how those concepts are exemplified by Microsoft Azure. It can be taken as a precursor to Microsoft’s [Azure](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/azure-exams.aspx) or Data and AI certifications. It will validate that you have the foundational knowledge you need as your start on your learning journey to become an Azure Administrator, Developer, Architect, or DevOps Engineer, and it can be used as a starting point for those of you interested in Data and AI job roles and our related certifications that we’ll be announcing soon.

Similarly, [Exam MS-900: M365 Fundamentals](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-MS-900.aspx) is designed for candidates looking to demonstrate foundational knowledge on the considerations and benefits of adopting cloud services in general and the Software as a Service (SaaS) cloud model. This exam also validates knowledge of available options and benefits gained by implementing Microsoft 365 cloud service offerings. It will validate that you have a solid understanding of the basics of Microsoft 365, preparing you for Microsoft 365 job roles, such as Modern Desktop Administrator, Teamwork Administrator, Messaging Administrator, and ultimately, Microsoft 365 Enterprise Administrator. This exam is an **optional** precursor to cloud computing and technologies exams, such as Office 365, Microsoft Intune, Microsoft Azure Information Protection (AIP), and Windows 10.

Remember that Fundamentals exams are not required for any of our role-based certifications, but if you’re just starting out in technology and thinking about a career change, or want to explore one of the technologies that will shape how organizations think about their digital transformations, one (or both?!) of these exams is for you. With any of our Fundamentals exams, technical IT experience is not required; however, some general IT knowledge or experience would be beneficial.

Now that I’ve piqued your interest, you’re probably wondering what the exams cover. We’ve published the exam details pages for each, so you can learn more—but you won’t be able to register for the M365 Fundamentals exam until December 29, 2018, or for the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals exam until December 31, 2018.

Check out what you need to know to pass [AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-AZ-900.aspx) and earn your [Microsoft Certified Azure Fundamentals](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/azure-fundamentals.aspx) certification.

Check out what you need to know to pass [MS-900: M365 Fundamentals](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/exam-MS-900.aspx).

Make a New Year’s resolution that you can actually keep—earn one of Microsoft’s new Fundamentals certifications in 2019.
