# Your path to success

Posted 7 Aug 2019 by **Nancy Tandy, Business Strategy Manager, Worldwide Learning**

Opportunities await in the tech world. Are you prepared to seize them? With the rapid expansion of data and advancement of technology across industries, there’s a growing demand for technical workers who have the skills and experience to meet these new challenges in the work environment. New solutions to improve field service, financial management, marketing, and sales, for example, depend on data integration, business analytics, and AI capabilities. And they all require new skills and higher levels of technical expertise. Acquiring new skills or improving your existing ones can help you land a job or a promotion and can win you recognition as a leader. Wherever you are in your career, Microsoft Learning can help you to achieve the expertise you want and to demonstrate that achievement—with industry-recognized certification—to employers.

## What is Microsoft Learning?

[Microsoft Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/default.aspx) is a carefully planned, comprehensive set of educational resources that lead to certification based on industry-defined roles and the specific skills needed to perform those roles. The roles you can be certified in include administrator, developer, data engineer, data scientist, business analyst, solutions architect, AI engineer, and functional consultant in sales or finance—with more on the way. All resources—from free, interactive, browser-based tutorials with Microsoft Learn to hands-on labs and instructor-led training with Microsoft Learning Partners—align to these roles, making sure that while you’re gaining specific skills you’re also targeting the goals of your chosen role.
