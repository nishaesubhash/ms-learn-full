# Share your insights on cloud and workplace technologies

Posted 19 Dec 2019 by **Marcy Donahue, Sr. Business Strategy Manager, WWL**

Cloud technologies are changing the way we all work—for the better—from individuals at small nonprofit organizations to IT teams in multinational corporations. If you have experience working with cloud and other workplace technologies, we’d love your insights. We’re looking to find out more about how individuals and companies deploy and administer these technologies, along with factors that influence their business value.

Care to share your thoughts? Please [take a short survey](http://selfserve.decipherinc.com/survey/selfserve/2192/190605?list=4#?) (no more than 15 minutes) and answer some questions about how training and certification can help with job performance, career trajectory, and more, particularly in the areas of Intelligent Cloud, Modern Workplace, and Business Applications. The survey asks about your organization, your role, and the services and tools you use, in addition to your training and certification experience and ongoing needs. Please note that your answers will be kept confidential and will not be associated with any personal data related to you or your organization but will only be reviewed in the aggregate.

Microsoft has teamed up with International Data Corporation (IDC), a leading technology market research firm, to gather and analyze information to help us ensure that we continue to offer the most valuable, useful, and relevant trainings and certifications as our industry grows and changes. Whether you’re a data engineer, an enterprise administrator, a solutions architect, or you wear another IT hat, we want to hear from you. We’ll be sure to share the global research study findings in an upcoming IDC white paper. Make your voice heard!
