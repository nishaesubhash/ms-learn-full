# Microsoft Certification: Simplifying the Journey

Posted 01 Oct 2018 by **Allison Kraker (Microsoft Program Manager)** 

___

As a member of the Microsoft Certified community, you’re familiar with the benefits of certification, from proven skills mastery and industry recognition to potential job opportunities and interested (and impressed!) hiring managers. And that’s not all. Tens of thousands of you who are Microsoft Certified have shared your accomplishments, transcripts, and credentials with colleagues and employers, you’ve accessed job leads to build successful careers, and you may even have increased your incomes. But, like any journey, it can always be improved.

But how? Microsoft recently asked you that very question: How would you improve your certification experience? You responded with helpful feedback, and we heard you loud and clear. You want to keep your tech skills relevant and competitive (check), you appreciate the recognition you earn (got it), and you value the boost to your career journey and salary (agreed). But you’d like one key change. You want tools and resources that Microsoft provides to be easier to find and to navigate. Thanks for that feedback! We’ve been working on it, and here’s what you can expect.

## Certification Dashboard, planner, and badging updates  

What’s different? At [Microsoft Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/ignite), we launched some changes to help meet the needs and requests of the Microsoft Certified community. You’ll still have your [Microsoft Certification Dashboard](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/dashboard.aspx) (with a clean, new look), complete with updated transcripts that can be downloaded or shared. The renovated dashboard will still give you access to register for exams, check your exam scores, find discounts, and manage your profile. Don’t forget that you can download your certificate as well! Your Certification Planner will also be freshened up, and all these useful features will be easier to access and use.

Over the next few months, we’ll be rolling out new features that integrate your certification badges directly into the [Microsoft Certification Dashboard](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/dashboard.aspx) rather than on a third-party site. So you’ll no longer need to go to a separate site to access and download your certification credentials. As always, the digital badge offers a Microsoft-verified credential that reflects the skills you’ve built and courses you’ve completed. And you can still share your badge on any professional profile or network you choose, including LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media, so hiring managers and recruiters can easily see your achievements. You can also download your badge and use it as a logo!

## Certification Marketplace and MCP Profile changes  

What’s retiring? The pay-to-print certificate and wallet card as well as logo downloads on Certification Marketplace will be retired. Don’t worry, though. If you’d like to purchase a wallet card or certificate, or download your logos, you have until October 31, 2018, to do so. [The MCP Profile](https://www.certmarketplace.com/Profile) feature will also retire, but all your certification information—exam scores, and certifications earned—will still be on your [dashboard and transcript](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/dashboard.aspx). If you’ve added biography or résumé details to your MCP Profile, be sure to copy them to LinkedIn or another professional networking site before October 31, 2018.

## New certifications and benefits

What’s new? As recently announced at Microsoft Ignite, we’ve got some new certification journeys, with a practical, job-role focus—check out [*New role-based certification and training is here, and we’re just getting started*!](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375159) Those of you who attended Microsoft Ignite may have enjoyed the Certification Celebration, created especially for you. We look forward to hosting more special events to recognize and acknowledge your achievements, meet you in person, give you opportunities to connect, and support your career path.

## In summary  

Here’s the short version. Along with evolving our certification program, we’re streamlining the journey to make things simpler and more relevant for you. You’ll still be able to keep your technical skills current, especially with the new job-role focus. And you can still get recognized and unlock benefits, like learning which employers are hiring people with Microsoft Certifications and what specific skills they want in a new hire. With easy-to-access digital badging, it’s easy to share your verified achievements when you apply for your next job. The certification tools and resources have a fresh new look, are easier to access, and are all in one place. Our goal remains to help you get hired, get recognized, and get ahead—and to provide you with what you need along the way.

Let’s keep the conversation going. Have more ideas? Share them in the comments below. Thanks for speaking up and for showing us how to simplify the journey to improve your certification experience. In the meantime, be sure to go to your MCP Profile page to download any information you want to keep, and check out your new [Microsoft Certification Dashboard](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/dashboard.aspx).
