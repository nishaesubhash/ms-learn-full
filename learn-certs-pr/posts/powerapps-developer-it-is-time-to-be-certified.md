Do you have a solid understanding of the Power Apps platform, including in-depth understanding of customization, configuration, integration, and extensibility, as well as its boundaries and constraints? Are you responsible for designing, developing, securing, and extending a platform implementation? Do you implement components of the solution that include application enhancements, custom user experience, system integrations, data conversions, custom process automation, and custom visualizations? If so, I have a great opportunity for you to showcase your skills and be recognized for them . . . take and pass this beta exam!

- [Find classroom and online training from Microsoft Learning Partners.](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/course-list.aspx)
- [Explore free learning paths, courses, and hands-on learning on Microsoft Learn.](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/browse)
- Need other preparation ideas? Check out my [blog post on preparing for beta exams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374544).

Taking a beta exam is your chance to have a voice in the questions we include on the exam when it goes live. The rescore process starts on the day that exams go live, and final scores are released approximately 10 days later. For updates on when the rescore is complete, follow me on Twitter ([@libertymunson](https://twitter.com/LibertyMunson)). For questions about the timing of beta exam scoring and live exam release, see the blog posts [The Path from Beta Exam to Live Exam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374675) and [More Tips About Beta Exams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374723).

Remember, the number of spots is limited, so when they're gone, they're gone. You should also be aware that there are some countries where the beta code will not work (including Turkey, Pakistan, India, and China). You will not be able to take the beta exam in those countries.

Also keep in mind that these exams are in beta, which means that you will not be scored immediately. You will receive your final score and passing status after your exam is live.
