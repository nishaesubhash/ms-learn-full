As developers come together to help the world solve new challenges—sharing knowledge and staying connected is more important than ever. Join your community to learn, connect, and code—to expand your skillset today, and innovate for tomorrow at [Microsoft Build](https://build.microsoft.com/). Microsoft Build will be a continuous, 48-hour digital event with around-the-clock programming beginning May 19, 2020 at 8am PDT. This is a unique opportunity to infuse learning into the entire event experience unlike ever before. Below is a sneak peek into what’s available at Microsoft Build along with a few key updates to our training and certification program.

You’ll have the chance to engage with Microsoft Learn modules in a team environment, compete for prizes in the Microsoft Build Cloud Skills Challenge, with an opportunity to earn a free certification exam.

As we continue to invest in skilling our customers, including future technology innovators, we’re thrilled to announce a [new home for students and educators on Microsoft Learn](/learn/roles/student?WT.mc_id=Build2020_alexblog)! In addition, we launched a new program, [Microsoft Learn for Educators](/learn/support/educator-resources?WT.mc_id=Build2020_alexblog), for academic instructors to access Microsoft curriculum and teaching materials across Azure and Power Platform fundamentals that are aligned to our certifications. These industry-recognized certifications augment a student’s existing degree path and validate the skills needed to be successful across a variety of technical careers.

While digital transformation reshapes how we do business, we understand the importance of keeping your technical skills up to date. And because there are different ways to learn, reimagining how we bring digital events is an opportunity for us to make your learning experience more seamless. We hope to see you online at Microsoft Build!
