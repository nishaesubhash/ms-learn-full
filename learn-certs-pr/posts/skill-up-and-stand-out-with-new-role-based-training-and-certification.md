# Skill up and stand out, with new role-based training and certification!

Posted 24 Sep 2018 by **Alex Payne (Director of Global Customer Learning, Microsoft)**

___

These days, IT teams are looking to fill roles with professionals who have the skills to work across multiple platforms with rapidly changing tools and technology. So, at Microsoft, we’re [evolving our training and certifications](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375159) to support you as you skill up and certify to fill those roles. To that end, we made some exciting announcements at [Ignite](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ignite), including our new learning experience, called [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/teamblog/introducing-ms-learn), plus fresh online and instructor-led training, and a full set of [new role-based certifications](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/browse-new-certification.aspx)—with more to come.

## The gap

If you’re wondering why this evolution is so important, consider cloud IT roles, as an example. These roles are among the first we explored and the first we announced, because more and more businesses and organizations are moving to the cloud. This move puts the spotlight on accelerating role specialization, and it brings to light a significant skills gap. Although 70% of CIOs have a “cloud-first strategy” and 85% of enterprises want to incorporate cloud architecture, only 16% of organizations have the required skills and processes.*

## The solution

To determine key job roles in the industry, we began with market research, which helped us to define and refine the overall list of roles and skills. Then we consulted with industry subject matter experts who are working in the field—both inside and outside of Microsoft—and aligned our new training options and certification experiences with the defined roles and skills.

## The change

So, it made perfect sense to us to expand our training and certification beyond individual technologies and to focus on the skills and concepts needed for specific job roles. We have hands-on training inspired by working professionals who teach you to apply these learnings in today’s demanding IT environment. And, with the new role-based certification, your improved productivity and next-level skills help you to become even more valuable to your team and organization.

## The training

Everyone has a different learning style. As you gear up to get certified, choose modalities that work best for you, including microlearning, online courses, instructor-led training, and more. Here’s a closer look at some of the popular training methods:

- **Microlearning** available on [Microsoft Learn](https://www.microsoft.com/learn) offers you the opportunity to learn Microsoft technologies and role-based concepts online for free, in an engaging and interactive way. These step-by-step tutorials provide a hands-on learning experience with easily accessed materials. Earn achievement badges to share with your networks.
- **Online courses** are always a favorite, given their flexibility, self-paced structure, and technical content partnerships with industry leaders, such as Pluralsight, LinkedIn Learning, edX, and Microsoft Learning Partners. Build practical job skills with a focus on the role-based certification you are pursuing.
- **Instructor-led training** with Microsoft Learning Partners offers deep technical expertise. Choose from in-person training, online training, or blended learning, as you prepare with the experts for certification in your job role.

## The certification

Training, exams, and certifications for [Azure Administrator,](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/azure-administrator.aspx) [Developer](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/azure-developer.aspx), and [Solutions Architect](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/azure-solutions-architect.aspx) are available now. We’ll be announcing Azure DevOps Engineer certification by the end of the year, along with exams and training for Microsoft 365 Administrator and Modern Desktop Administrator. Want the details? Check out Selina Winter’s latest blog post, [New role-based training and certification is here, and we’re just getting started](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=375159)! Selina takes an in-depth look at the specifics of the new Microsoft Certification Program, and she answers some questions you might have as you get ready to get recognized.

## The opportunity
