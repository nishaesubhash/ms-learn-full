# The Azure DevOps Expert certification will have a new name

Posted 07 May 2020 by **Sandra Marin, Azure training and certification GTM lead, Microsoft Learning**

___

We’re excited to share some news about the Azure certification portfolio. Effective May 15, 2020, the [Azure DevOps Engineer Expert certification](/learn/certifications/azure-devops) will have a new name: **Microsoft Certified: DevOps Engineer Expert**.

This update is a result of our regular review of Microsoft Certifications. We want to make sure that they stay current with the skills, experience, and technology required for the job roles that can help guide your organization through a successful digital transformation.

The new name reflects our vision for the job role and today’s required skills, along with the direction we’ll take as we include additional skills in the future. DevOps Engineers combine people, processes, and technologies to continuously deliver products and services. They use built-in Azure services, such as Azure DevOps, and they can integrate with Azure using lightweight tools and features from GitHub or open-source DevOps tools.

To align with the certification name, we’ll update the exam name to [**Exam AZ-400: Designing and Implementing Microsoft DevOps Solutions**](/learn/certifications/exams/az-400). Please note that the exam number remains the same.

## Do you already have an Azure DevOps Engineer Expert certification? We’ve got you covered.

**Effective May 15, 2020**, the new certification and exam names will be reflected on your online transcript. You don’t need to do anything but verify the name change on your [Microsoft Certification dashboard](https://www.microsoft.com/learning/dashboard.aspx), where you’ll also see a new digital badge. Take this opportunity to share your new badge and prove your achievement to the world.

## Considering this certification? Don’t let the name change stop you.

Although we’re changing the name, the job role and exam objective domains remain the same. To prepare for exam AZ-400, get familiar with the measured skills, such as implementing continuous integration, continuous delivery, dependency management, and more, as outlined on the exam page. And explore our recommendations for free online Microsoft Learn content, along with instructor-led training available through one of our many Learning Partners.

Whether you’ve already earned your certification or you’re preparing to take exam AZ-400, we look forward to sharing your journey as we work to continuously improve your certification experience.
