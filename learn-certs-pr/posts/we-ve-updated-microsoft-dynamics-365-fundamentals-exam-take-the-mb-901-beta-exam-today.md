# We’ve Updated Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundamentals Exam: Take the MB-901 Beta Exam Today!

Posted 31 Dec 2019 by **Liberty Munson (Microsoft)**

As many of you know, about 9 months ago, we launched MB-900: Microsoft Dynamics 365 Fundamentals exam. During that time, Power Platform has started gaining attention by enterprises and momentum among users, so we decided to remove that content from MB-900 and create a Fundamentals exam specific to that content (learn more about PL-900: Microsoft Power Platform Fundamentals [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/learn/certifications/exams/pl-900?WT.mc_id=msignitethetour2019_PL900blog_cert_examspl900-blog-wwl)).

In the course of doing this, we refocused MB-900 on measuring candidate’s understanding the benefits of adopting Dynamics 365. For example, we added “understanding integration capabilities” and “identify Dynamics 365 reporting capabilities,” and we expanded objectives such as “Understand Customer Engagement Apps” and “Understand F+O Apps” into functional groups. What this means is that we had to create so much new content to support the changes in the content domain that we need to treat this as if it’s a new exam…and this means that need to go through the beta process to ensure that our content is as good as it can be. So, in a nutshell, we need beta candidates to take the new version of the exam. You will earn the same certification but will be tested on more relevant knowledge of the basic concepts related to Microsoft Dynamics 365.

Who should take this beta exam? Candidates should have a functional understanding of Dynamics 365 capabilities and Microsoft cloud computing and a basic understanding of business scenarios and experience in addressing business, legal, and security requirements for IT projects. Is this you? If so, read on…

Do you aspire to improve productivity by automating business processes, analyzing data to produce business insights, and acting more effectively by creating simple app experiences? Can you describe the Power Platform components: PowerApps, Power BI, Microsoft Flow, Common Data Service (CDS), connectors, and AI builder as well as cross-cloud scenarios with representation across Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Azure, and third-party services? Can you identify benefits and capabilities of Power Platform as well as the basic functionality and business value Power Platform components? Can you implement simple solutions with Microsoft Flow, Power BI, and AI Builder and create a basic app in a no-code environment?

Did you answer ‘yes’ to some of those questions? For those of you who did, this beta exam is a great opportunity for you to showcase your skills and be recognized for them!

Taking a beta exam is your chance to have a voice in the questions we include on the exam when it goes live. The rescore process starts on the day that exams go live, and final scores are released approximately 10 days later. For updates on when the rescore is complete, follow me on Twitter ([@libertymunson](https://twitter.com/LibertyMunson)). For questions about the timing of beta exam scoring and live exam release, see the blog posts [The Path from Beta Exam to Live Exam](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374675) and [More Tips About Beta Exams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/learning/community-blog-post.aspx?BlogId=8&Id=374723).

Remember, the number of spots is limited, so when they're gone, they're gone. You should also be aware that there are some countries where the beta code will not work (including Turkey, Pakistan, India, and China). You will not be able to take the beta exam in those countries.

Also keep in mind that these exams are in beta, which means that you will not be scored immediately. You will receive your final score and passing status after your exam is live.
