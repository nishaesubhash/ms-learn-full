# Transition Exams Are Retiring Soon! Don&#39;t Miss Your Chance to Upgrade to Role-based Certifications

Posted 23 May 2019 by **Liberty Munson (Microsoft)**

___

As you know, Microsoft recently developed role-based certifications to more closely align with the needs of organizations as they address cloud-related skill gaps in their workforce. To streamline our certification program and help meet these needs, certain exams are being retired and replaced with new role-based exams.

If you’ve demonstrated your expertise by passing any of the following 70-xxx series exams, you’re eligible to take a single transition exam to earn the latest Microsoft role-based certification. Take advantage of this opportunity before the transition exam retires; otherwise, you’ll need to take two exams to earn the associated certification. (Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate is the exception, with one required exam.)

So here’s my question to you: Have you passed one of the exams in the first column? If so, prove your skills are up to date by passing a transition exam. Priced at $99 USD,* the transition exams are available for a limited time, so act now. After they retire (see retirement dates in the following table), to achieve the role-based certification, you must take two required exams (at $165 USD each*).

*Price varies by country/region
